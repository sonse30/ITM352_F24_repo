Workout Tracker Banner https://via.placeholder.com/1000x300.png?text=Workout+Tracker

A simple and intuitive workout tracker application that innovates by showing realtime gym progress over time. Progress that can inspire users to keep going at it in the gym and make some gains! Unlike most fitness apps that just track your weight and diet, this tool will help regular gym goers to track how much strength they gained overtime!

Features

Log Exercises**: Record sets, reps, and weights for your chosen workouts. 
Progress Visualization**: View interactive graphs of your different workout progress over time. 
User-Friendly Design**: Clean, responsive interface built with Bootstrap. Allowing users of any technology experience to easily adapt to the program offered for free.
Exercise list**: Although we really wanted to add the calorie calculator for food, the code offers little ability to track all different foods and their nutrients and calories. So, we instead focused more on the weightlifting aspect and added key exercises for new beginners to include into their workout. We added workouts for the chest, back, legs, arms, and shoulders.
